### Image Preprocessing Pipeline for Damaged Car Detection Using OpenCV  

In computer vision, preprocessing is crucial for enhancing raw image quality and optimizing it for analysis. This project focuses on an **image preprocessing pipeline** tailored for detecting car damage using **OpenCV**. The pipeline improves image clarity, reduces noise, and extracts relevant features to aid downstream tasks like segmentation and classification.

### **Pipeline Steps**
1. **Image Acquisition & Loading**  
   - Load the damaged car image using OpenCV (`cv2.imread()`).
   - Convert it to grayscale (`cv2.cvtColor()`), simplifying data for processing.

2. **Noise Reduction & Smoothing**  
   - Apply **Gaussian Blur** (`cv2.GaussianBlur()`) to remove unnecessary noise while retaining important details.

3. **Contrast Enhancement**  
   - Use **Histogram Equalization** (`cv2.equalizeHist()`) or **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** to improve visibility of damaged areas.

4. **Edge Detection & Contouring**  
   - Apply **Canny Edge Detection** (`cv2.Canny()`) to highlight sharp boundaries of dents and scratches.
   - Detect and analyze contours (`cv2.findContours()`) to locate damaged sections.

5. **Segmentation & Masking**  
   - Use **Thresholding** (`cv2.threshold()`) or **Adaptive Thresholding** to isolate the damaged parts.
   - Create masks for specific regions of interest to refine detection.

6. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Extract **keypoints** using algorithms like **ORB, SIFT**, or **SURF**, which help in identifying unique damage features.
   - Use **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** to detect edges and textures.

7. **Integration with Streamlit for Visualization**  
   - Streamlit helps in developing an interactive web application for easy visualization of preprocessing steps.
   - Users can upload images and see real-time results.
